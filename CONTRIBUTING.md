## let's make a fork

To contribute you need to fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:your-name/create-file.git
```
You can run `make`, but you may have conflicts others push commits with their build

## what if conflicts are comming?

you may have conflict because there is build date/time in build file

make sure you're on devel branch and create PR to devel brach as well,
fixes to examples and README can be made directly to master but they could also be made to devel.
